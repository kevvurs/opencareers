# OpenCareers
_power to the people_

## About
OpenCareers is a new way to find a job. Where other services
promote isolation and competition, OC encourages community
and crowd-sourcing. We have all heard of person who got a
job because they knew-someone-who-knew-someone. That's because
finding work should be social! With OC, users leverage the
power of crowd-sourcing to share and find career opportunities.
