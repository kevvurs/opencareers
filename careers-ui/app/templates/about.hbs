      About OpenCareers
    </h2>
    <p>
      <b>OpenCareers</b> is a project I started to help share job listings
      with my girlfriend. It was designed for people crowdsource job
      listings. I want to create a platform for job-seekers to collaborate
      and congregate. Traditional job lists online have a many-to-1 feel.
      I despise this. Finding work is social. OpenCareers offers a new
      many-to-many environment for our members.
